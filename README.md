**# Module11_Web-Scraping repository shares files that have completed Part1 and Part2**

**Part 1: Mars News Scraping**
1.1 Automated Browsing and HTML Extraction
Utilized Splinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup for HTML extraction.
The code for this process is available in the file part_1_mars_news.ipynb.
1.2 Title and Preview Text Extraction
Successfully scraped and extracted titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
All extracted information is stored in a Python data structureâ€”a list of dictionaries.
The output is saved as news_data.json.

**Part 2: Mars Weather Data Analysis**
2.1 HTML Table Extraction
Extracted Mars weather data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used for data scraping.
